## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

Before upgrading to a new Soroban version:

- [ ] Review [Soroban SDK release notes](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/releases)
- [ ] Check [Stellar Protocol upgrade announcements](https://stellar.org/developers)
- [ ] Backup current contract deployments and state
- [ ] Document current gas benchmark baseline
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass on current version
- [ ] Review breaking changes and deprecations
- [ ] Plan testnet validation window
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of upgrade timeline
- [ ] **Verify admin role transfer security across all contracts**
- [ ] **Run comprehensive admin role regression tests**

## Admin Role Transfer Security

### Overview

All RemitWise contracts implement a dual-admin system with strict security controls:

- **PAUSE_ADM**: Controls pause/unpause operations and emergency functions
- **UPG_ADM**: Controls version upgrades and contract migrations

### Security Requirements

#### Bootstrap Pattern (Bill Payments, Insurance, Savings Goals)
```rust
// Initial admin setup - caller must equal new_admin
if current_admin.is_none() {
    if caller != new_admin {
        return Err(Error::Unauthorized);
    }
}
```

#### Owner-Based Pattern (Remittance Split, Family Wallet)
```rust
// Initial admin setup - only contract owner can set
if current_admin.is_none() {
    if caller != owner {
        return Err(Error::Unauthorized);
    }
}
```

#### Transfer Pattern (All Contracts)
```rust
// Admin transfer - only current admin can transfer
if let Some(current) = current_admin {
    if caller != current {
        return Err(Error::Unauthorized);
    }
}
```

### Critical Security Assumptions

1. **No Unauthorized Bootstrap**: Contracts must prevent unauthorized parties from setting initial admin
2. **Transfer Isolation**: Only current admin can transfer to new admin
3. **Cross-Contract Isolation**: Admin of one contract cannot control another
4. **Pause Resistance**: Admin functions must work even when contract is paused
5. **Event Auditing**: All admin transfers must emit events for audit trail

### Admin Role Regression Tests

Run comprehensive regression tests before any upgrade:

```bash
# Run multi-contract admin role tests
cargo test -p integration_tests test_bootstrap_admin_setup_all_contracts
cargo test -p integration_tests test_unauthorized_bootstrap_attempts
cargo test -p integration_tests test_authorized_admin_transfer
cargo test -p integration_tests test_unauthorized_admin_transfer
cargo test -p integration_tests test_admin_operations_while_paused
cargo test -p integration_tests test_version_upgrade_authorization
cargo test -p integration_tests test_cross_contract_admin_isolation
cargo test -p integration_tests test_admin_transfer_edge_cases
cargo test -p integration_tests test_admin_transfer_events
```

### Locked-State Behavior Testing

Verify admin operations work correctly when contracts are paused:

```bash
# Test admin functions during pause state
cargo test -p integration_tests test_admin_operations_while_paused

# Test emergency scenarios
cargo test -p bill_payments test_emergency_pause_all
cargo test -p insurance test_emergency_pause_all
```

## Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Environment Preparation

```bash
# Create a new branch for the upgrade
git checkout -b upgrade/soroban-vX.Y.Z

# Backup current gas benchmarks
cp gas_results.json gas_results_baseline_vOLD.json

# Document current versions
soroban version > versions_before_upgrade.txt
rustc --version >> versions_before_upgrade.txt
```

### Step 2: Update Dependencies

Update all contract `Cargo.toml` files:

```bash
# Use find and sed to update all contracts at once (Unix/Linux/macOS)
find . -name "Cargo.toml" -type f -exec sed -i 's/soroban-sdk = "OLD_VERSION"/soroban-sdk = "NEW_VERSION"/g' {} +

# Or manually update each contract:
# - remittance_split/Cargo.toml
# - savings_goals/Cargo.toml
# - bill_payments/Cargo.toml
# - insurance/Cargo.toml
# - family_wallet/Cargo.toml
# - data_migration/Cargo.toml
# - reporting/Cargo.toml
# - orchestrator/Cargo.toml
```

### Step 3: Update Soroban CLI

```bash
# Install new CLI version
cargo install --locked --version X.Y.Z soroban-cli

# Verify installation
soroban version

# Update README installation instructions
# Edit README.md to reflect new version
```

### Step 4: Clean Build

```bash
# Remove all build artifacts
cargo clean
rm -rf target/
rm Cargo.lock

# Update dependencies
cargo update

# Build all contracts
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Step 5: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
cargo test

# Run tests with verbose output to catch warnings
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific contract tests
cargo test -p remittance_split
cargo test -p savings_goals
cargo test -p bill_payments
cargo test -p insurance
cargo test -p family_wallet
cargo test -p reporting
cargo test -p orchestrator

# CRITICAL: Run admin role regression tests
cargo test -p integration_tests multi_contract_integration
```

### Step 6: Gas Benchmark Comparison

```bash
# Run new benchmarks
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh

# Compare against baseline (10% threshold)
./scripts/compare_gas_results.sh gas_results_baseline_vOLD.json gas_results.json 10

# Review any significant changes
# Document performance improvements or regressions
```

### Step 7: Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Build optimized contracts
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Deploy each contract to testnet
for contract in remittance_split savings_goals bill_payments insurance family_wallet reporting orchestrator; do
  echo "Deploying $contract..."
  soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/${contract}.wasm \
    --source <your-testnet-key> \
    --network testnet
done

# Save contract IDs for testing
```

### Step 8: Integration Testing

Run integration tests on testnet:

```bash
# Test remittance split
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <remittance-split-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize_split \
  --owner <address> \
  --spending_percent 40 \
  --savings_percent 30 \
  --bills_percent 20 \
  --insurance_percent 10

# Test savings goals
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <savings-goals-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_goal \
  --owner <address> \
  --name "Education" \
  --target_amount 100000 \
  --target_date <timestamp>

# Test bill payments
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <bill-payments-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_bill \
  --owner <address> \
  --name "Electricity" \
  --amount 5000 \
  --due_date <timestamp> \
  --recurring false

# Test insurance
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <insurance-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_policy \
  --owner <address> \
  --name "Health Insurance" \
  --coverage_type "Health" \
  --monthly_premium 2000 \
  --coverage_amount 50000

# Verify events are emitted correctly
soroban events --id <contract-id> --network testnet
```

### Step 9: Documentation Updates

```bash
# Update README.md compatibility section
# Update DEPLOYMENT.md with any new deployment steps
# Update this UPGRADE_GUIDE.md with version-specific notes
# Update inline code comments if APIs changed
```

### Step 10: Commit and Review

```bash
