# Integration Tests — Remitwise Contracts

## Overview

This crate contains integration tests for the Remitwise smart contract ecosystem.
Tests cover multi-contract interactions, rollback semantics, accounting consistency,
and recovery behavior across all remittance flow legs.

## Running the Tests

### Run orchestrator unit tests only
```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator
```

### Run integration tests only
```bash
cargo test -p integration_tests
```

### Run all tests
```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator && cargo test -p integration_tests
```

### Run a specific test by name
```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator test_rollback_bills_leg_bill_not_found
cargo test -p integration_tests test_integration_rollback_insurance_leg
```

### Run with output printed (recommended for first run)
```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator -- --nocapture
cargo test -p integration_tests -- --nocapture
```

## Test Structure

### `orchestrator/src/test.rs` — Unit Tests

Unit tests for the orchestrator contract using mock implementations of all
downstream contracts. Tests are self-contained and do not require real contract
deployments.

## Mock Contract Behavior Reference

### `MockFamilyWallet`
| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `amount <= 10_000` (unit tests) | Returns `true` (approved) |
| `amount <= 100_000` (integration tests) | Returns `true` (approved) |
| `amount > limit` | Returns `false` → `PermissionDenied` |

### `MockSavingsGoals`
| `goal_id` | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `1` (or any valid) | Returns `amount` (success) |
| `998` | Panics: "Goal already completed" |
| `999` | Panics: "Goal not found" |

### `MockBillPayments`
| `bill_id` | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `1` (or any valid) | No-op (success) |
| `998` | Panics: "Bill already paid" |
| `999` | Panics: "Bill not found" |

### `MockInsurance`
| `policy_id` | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `1` (or any valid) | Returns `true` (success) |
| `998` | Returns `false` (inactive policy — soft failure) |
| `999` | Panics: "Policy not found" |

### `MockRemittanceSplit`
Always returns a `[40%, 30%, 20%, 10%]` split:
- Index 0: spending = `total * 40 / 100`
- Index 1: savings  = `total * 30 / 100`
- Index 2: bills    = `total * 20 / 100`
- Index 3: insurance = remainder (ensures sum == total)

---

## Rollback Semantics

The orchestrator relies on **Soroban's panic/revert atomicity guarantee**:

> If any cross-contract call panics during a transaction, **all state changes
> made within that transaction are automatically reverted** by the Soroban runtime.

This means:
- If the savings leg panics → bills and insurance were never called; savings state reverts
- If the bills leg panics → savings state also reverts (even though it completed)
- If the insurance leg panics → both savings and bills state revert

There is **no manual rollback logic** in the orchestrator itself. The contract
delegates rollback responsibility entirely to the Soroban execution environment.

### Soft vs Hard Failures

Some failure conditions produce a **soft failure** (the orchestrator records
`*_success = false` but does not panic) vs a **hard failure** (the downstream
contract panics, causing a full transaction revert):

| Scenario | Type | Result |
|----------|------|--------|
| Downstream contract panics | Hard | Full transaction revert |
| `check_spending_limit` returns `false` | Hard | `PermissionDenied` error returned |
| Insurance `pay_premium` returns `false` | Soft | `insurance_success = false` in result |
| `total_amount <= 0` | Hard | `InvalidAmount` error returned |

---

## Security Assumptions

1. **Atomicity**: Soroban guarantees all-or-nothing execution. No partial state
   can persist from a failed transaction.

2. **Authorization**: Every public function calls `caller.require_auth()` before
   any state-modifying operation. Unauthorized callers cannot execute flows.

3. **Input validation**: `total_amount` is validated as positive before any
   cross-contract calls are made.

4. **Spending limits**: The Family Wallet contract enforces per-caller spending
   limits. The orchestrator checks this before executing any downstream legs.

5. **No re-entrancy**: Soroban's execution model prevents re-entrant calls.
   Each cross-contract call completes fully before the next instruction executes.

6. **No overflow**: The `soroban-sdk` uses `i128` for amounts. Arithmetic in mock
   contracts uses standard Rust multiplication/division which will panic on overflow
   in debug mode, triggering a rollback.

## Coverage Notes

- All three downstream legs (savings, bills, insurance) have failure scenarios
- Each failure position in the flow is tested (first, middle, last leg)
- Boundary conditions on amounts are covered (0, 1, limit, limit+1, negative)
- State isolation between transactions is verified (rollback does not poison future calls)
- Accounting invariants (sum of allocations == total) are verified on success paths
- Recovery behavior after each leg failure type is verified
