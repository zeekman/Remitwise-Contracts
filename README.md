# RemitWise Smart Contracts

Stellar Soroban smart contracts for the RemitWise remittance platform.

## Overview

This workspace contains the core smart contracts that power RemitWise's post-remittance financial planning features:

- **remittance_split**: Automatically splits remittances into spending, savings, bills, and insurance
- **savings_goals**: Goal-based savings with target dates and locked funds
- **bill_payments**: Automated bill payment tracking and scheduling
- **insurance**: Micro-insurance policy management and premium payments
- **family_wallet**: Family governance, multisig approvals, and emergency transfer controls
- **remitwise-common**: Shared types and utilities used across contracts

## Shared Components

### remitwise-common

A common crate containing shared types, enums, and constants used across multiple contracts.

**Shared Types:**
- `Category`: Financial categories (Spending, Savings, Bills, Insurance)
- `FamilyRole`: Access control roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- `CoverageType`: Insurance coverage types (Health, Life, Property, Auto, Liability)
- `EventCategory` & `EventPriority`: Event logging categories and priorities

**Shared Constants:**
- Pagination limits (`DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT`, `MAX_PAGE_LIMIT`)
- Storage TTL values (`INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`, `ARCHIVE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`, etc.)
- Contract versioning (`CONTRACT_VERSION`)
- Batch operation limits (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`)

**Shared Utilities:**
- `clamp_limit()`: Helper for pagination limit validation
- `RemitwiseEvents`: Standardized event emission with `emit()` and `emit_batch()` methods

## Shared Enums & Constants Stability Coverage

This project now includes dedicated compatibility guards in `remitwise-common` to prevent breaking changes across dependent contracts.

- invariant tests for enum discriminants and event tags
- ordering assumptions verified for role and coverage definitions
- round-trip serialization via `soroban_sdk::IntoVal`/`TryFromVal`
- event topic and payload serialization checks for `RemitwiseEvents`
- pagination and TTL constant stability assertions

### Running the new coverage

```bash
cargo test -p remitwise-common
```

### Security notes

- Enums are `#[repr(u32)]` and are asserted in tests, reducing risk of contract integration drift
- Shared constants used for pagination, batch size, storage TTL, and signature timeout are locked with stability checks
- `clamp_limit()` now has explicit tests for overflow, underflow, and boundary conditions

## CLI Tool

A custom Rust CLI is provided for interacting with the contracts without a UI.

See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for usage instructions.

### Additional Components

- **indexer**: TypeScript event indexer for off-chain querying and analytics ([Documentation](indexer/README.md))
- **analytics**: On-chain analytics and reporting
- **orchestrator**: Cross-contract coordination
- **reporting**: Financial reporting and insights

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Stellar CLI (soroban-cli)
- Cargo

| Protocol 21+ | -       | ⚠️ Untested   | Should be compatible, validation recommended |

### Upgrading to New Soroban Versions

When a new Soroban SDK or protocol version is released, follow these steps to validate and upgrade:

#### 1. Review Release Notes

Check the [Soroban SDK releases](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/releases) for:

- Breaking changes in contract APIs
- New features or optimizations
- Deprecated functions
- Protocol version requirements

#### 2. Update Dependencies

Update the SDK version in all contract `Cargo.toml` files:

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "X.Y.Z"

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "X.Y.Z", features = ["testutils"] }
```

Contracts to update:

- `remittance_split/Cargo.toml`
- `savings_goals/Cargo.toml`
- `bill_payments/Cargo.toml`
- `insurance/Cargo.toml`
- `family_wallet/Cargo.toml`
- `data_migration/Cargo.toml`
- `reporting/Cargo.toml`
- `orchestrator/Cargo.toml`

#### 3. Update Soroban CLI

```bash
cargo install --locked --version X.Y.Z soroban-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
soroban version
```

#### 4. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
cargo clean

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run gas benchmarks to check for performance regressions
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh
```

#### 5. Validate on Testnet

Deploy contracts to testnet and run integration tests:

```bash
# Build optimized contracts
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Deploy to testnet
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet

# Test contract interactions
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <contract-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- <function-name> <args>
```

#### 6. Check for Breaking Changes

Common breaking changes to watch for:

- **Storage API changes**: TTL management, archival patterns
- **Event emission**: Topic structure or data format changes
- **Authorization**: Auth context or signature verification changes
- **Numeric types**: Changes to `i128`, `u128`, or fixed-point math
- **Contract lifecycle**: Initialization or upgrade patterns

#### 7. Update Documentation

After successful validation:

- Update this compatibility section with new versions
- Document any migration steps in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Update code examples if APIs changed
- Regenerate contract bindings if needed

### Known Breaking Changes

#### SDK 21.0.0 (Current)

No breaking changes from previous stable releases affecting these contracts.

#### Future Considerations

- **Protocol 21+**: May introduce new storage pricing or TTL requirements
- **SDK 22.0.0+**: Monitor for changes to contract storage patterns, event APIs, or authorization flows

### Network Protocol Versions

The contracts are designed to be compatible with:

- **Testnet**: Currently running Protocol 20+
- **Mainnet**: Currently running Protocol 20+

Check current network protocol versions:

```bash
# Testnet
soroban network container logs stellar 2>&1 | grep "protocol version"

# Or via RPC
curl -X POST https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getNetwork","params":[]}'
```

### Troubleshooting Version Issues

**Build Errors After Upgrade:**

```bash
# Clear all caches
cargo clean
rm -rf target/
rm Cargo.lock

# Rebuild
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

**Test Failures:**

- Check for deprecated test utilities in SDK release notes
- Verify mock contract behavior hasn't changed
- Review event emission format changes

**Deployment Issues:**

- Ensure CLI version matches SDK version
- Verify network is running compatible protocol version
- Check for new deployment flags or requirements

For full design details, see [docs/family-wallet-design.md](docs/family-wallet-design.md).

## Events

All contracts emit events for important state changes, enabling real-time tracking and frontend integration. Events follow Soroban best practices and include:

- **Relevant IDs**: All events include the ID of the entity being acted upon
- **Amounts**: Financial events include transaction amounts
- **Timestamps**: All events include the ledger timestamp for accurate tracking
- **Context Data**: Additional contextual information (names, dates, etc.)

### Event Topics

Each contract uses short symbol topics for efficient event identification:

- **Remittance Split**: `init`, `calc`
- **Savings Goals**: `created`, `added`, `completed`
- **Bill Payments**: `created`, `paid`, `recurring`
- **Insurance**: `created`, `paid`, `deactive`
- **Family Wallet**: `added/member`, `updated/limit`, `emerg/*`, `wallet/*`

### Querying Events

Events can be queried from the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK or via the Horizon API for frontend integration. Each event structure is exported and can be decoded using the contract's schema.

## Testing

Run tests for all contracts:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run tests for a specific contract:

```bash
cd remittance_split
cargo test
```

### Integration Tests

Multi-contract integration tests verify that all contracts work together correctly:

```bash
# Run all integration tests
cargo test -p integration_tests

# Run with output
cargo test -p integration_tests -- --nocapture
```

The integration tests simulate real user flows:

- Deploy all contracts (remittance_split, savings_goals, bill_payments, insurance)
- Initialize split configuration
- Create goals, bills, and policies
- Calculate split and verify amounts align with expectations

See [integration_tests/README.md](integration_tests/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Cross-Contract Invariant Tests

Verify that allocations across contracts are consistent with remittance splits:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_cross_contract_invariants.py
```

See [scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md](scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md) for details.

### USDC remittance split checks (local & CI)

- `cargo test -p remittance_split` exercises the USDC distribution logic with a mocked Stellar Asset Contract (`env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2`) and built-in auth mocking.
- The suite covers minting the payer account, splitting across spending/savings/bills/insurance, and asserting balances along with the new allocation metadata helper.
- The same command is intended for CI so it runs without manual setup; re-run locally whenever split logic changes or new USDC paths are added.

### Orchestrator audit log pagination correctness

The orchestrator audit API (`get_audit_log(from_index, limit)`) supports cursor-based pagination for compliance and monitoring clients.

**Pagination guarantees:**
- Results are ordered from oldest to newest in the current bounded audit window.
- `from_index` is a stable zero-based cursor within that bounded window.
- `limit` is clamped to contract maximum capacity (`MAX_AUDIT_ENTRIES`) for predictable gas and memory usage.
- Page-end calculation uses saturating arithmetic to prevent cursor overflow edge cases.
- Out-of-range cursors return an empty page (safe default).

**Security assumptions and notes:**
- Consumers should treat the cursor as a position in the current rotated window, not an immutable global ID.
- Log rotation drops oldest records at capacity, so clients should read promptly and persist externally if long-term retention is required.
- Tests assert no duplicate entries across sequential pages under heavy execution history and rotation pressure.

Run orchestrator tests (including pagination correctness coverage):

```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator
```

## Gas Benchmarks

RemitWise includes a comprehensive gas benchmarking harness for tracking and optimizing contract performance.

### Quick Start

Run all benchmarks and generate a JSON report:

```bash
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh
```

This creates `gas_results.json` with CPU and memory costs for all contract operations.

### Regression Detection

Compare current results against baseline to detect performance regressions:

```bash
./scripts/compare_gas_results.sh benchmarks/baseline.json gas_results.json
```

The comparison fails if CPU or memory increases exceed configured thresholds (default 10%).

### Update Baseline

After verifying optimizations:

```bash
./scripts/update_baseline.sh
```

### Documentation

- **[Benchmarking Guide](benchmarks/README.md)**: Complete benchmarking documentation
- **[Gas Optimization Guide](docs/gas-optimization.md)**: Optimization strategies and best practices
- **[Baseline Results](benchmarks/baseline.json)**: Current performance baseline
- **[Threshold Configuration](benchmarks/thresholds.json)**: Regression detection thresholds

### CI Integration

Gas benchmarks run automatically in CI on every push and pull request. Results are:

- Compared against baseline for regression detection
- Uploaded as artifacts (retained for 30 days)
- Posted as PR comments with comparison details

To view CI results:

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download the `gas-benchmarks` artifact
4. View `gas_results.json` for metrics

### Individual Contract Benchmarks

Run benchmarks for a specific contract:

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p bill_payments --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p savings_goals --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p insurance --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p family_wallet --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p remittance_split --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
```

## Deployment

### Automated Bootstrap Deployment

The fastest way to deploy all contracts with sensible defaults:

```bash
# Deploy to testnet with default settings
./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer

# Skip building if contracts are already built
SKIP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer

# Deploy to mainnet
./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh mainnet deployer

# Custom output file location
OUTPUT_FILE=./my-contracts.json ./scripts/bootstrap_deploy.sh testnet deployer
```

The bootstrap script will:
1. Build all WASM artifacts (unless SKIP_BUILD=1)
2. Deploy each contract via soroban-cli
3. Initialize contracts with sensible defaults:
   - Remittance split: 50% spending, 30% savings, 15% bills, 5% insurance
   - One example savings goal
   - One example bill
   - One example insurance policy
4. Output contract IDs in a JSON file (default: `deployed-contracts.json`)

The generated JSON file can be easily consumed by frontend/backend:

```json
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "deployer": "GXXXXXXX...",
  "deployed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "contracts": {
    "remittance_split": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "savings_goals": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "bill_payments": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "insurance": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "family_wallet": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "reporting": "CXXXXXXX...",
    "orchestrator": "CXXXXXXX..."
  }
}
```

### Manual Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive manual deployment instructions.

Quick deploy to testnet:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/remittance_split.wasm \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet
```

## Operational Limits

ID and record-count operating limits (including `u32` overflow analysis and monitoring alerts) are documented in the **Operational Limits and Monitoring** section of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development

This is a basic MVP implementation. Future enhancements:

- Integration with Stellar Asset Contract (USDC)
- Cross-contract calls for automated allocation
- Multi-signature support for family wallets
- Emergency mode with priority processing

## Security

### Threat Model

A comprehensive security review and threat model is available in [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md). This document identifies:

- **Critical Assets**: User funds, configuration, identity, and data
- **Threat Scenarios**: Unauthorized access, reentrancy, DoS, economic attacks
- **Existing Mitigations**: Authorization patterns, pause mechanisms, input validation
- **Security Gaps**: Areas requiring immediate attention before mainnet deployment

**Key Security Issues:**
- [SECURITY-001] Add Authorization to Reporting Contract Queries (HIGH)
- [SECURITY-002] Implement Reentrancy Protection in Orchestrator (HIGH)
- [SECURITY-003] Add Rate Limiting to Emergency Transfers (HIGH)
- [SECURITY-004] Replace Checksum with Cryptographic Hash (MEDIUM)
- [SECURITY-005] Implement Storage Bounds and Entity Limits (MEDIUM)

See the [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) directory for detailed security issue descriptions.

### Security Best Practices

When integrating with these contracts:

1. **Always verify caller authorization** before performing sensitive operations
2. **Monitor events** for suspicious activity patterns
3. **Implement rate limiting** at the application layer
4. **Use multi-signature** for high-value operations
5. **Regular security audits** before major releases
6. **Incident response plan** for security events
