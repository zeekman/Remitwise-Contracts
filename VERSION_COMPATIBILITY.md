## Known Limitations

### SDK 21.0.0

1. **Storage Limits**: Standard Soroban storage limits apply
   - Max entry size: 64KB
   - TTL management required for long-term storage

2. **Cross-Contract Calls**: Limited call depth
   - Max depth: 4 levels
   - Orchestrator designed within limits

3. **Event Size**: Events have size limitations
   - Keep event data concise
   - Use references for large data

### Protocol 20

1. **Network Limits**: Standard network resource limits
   - Transaction size limits
   - Ledger entry limits
   - CPU/memory budgets

## Snapshot Schema Versioning

Each contract that supports data export/import carries an explicit **schema version tag**
inside every snapshot it produces. This is separate from the contract deployment version
(`get_version()`).

### Constants (workspace-wide)

| Constant | Value | Contract(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `SCHEMA_VERSION` | 1 | remittance_split, savings_goals, data_migration |
| `MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` / `MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION` | 1 | all three |
| `SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (alias) | 1 | data_migration |

### Snapshot struct fields

| Contract | Struct | Schema version field |
|---|---|---|
| `remittance_split` | `ExportSnapshot` | `schema_version: u32` |
| `savings_goals` | `GoalsExportSnapshot` | `schema_version: u32` |
| `data_migration` | `SnapshotHeader` | `version: u32` (= `SCHEMA_VERSION`) |

### Import validation rules

All `import_snapshot` entry points validate the schema version against the
supported range before applying any data:

```
MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION <= snapshot.schema_version <= SCHEMA_VERSION
```

- **Too old** (`schema_version < MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`): rejected as `UnsupportedVersion`.
- **Too new** (`schema_version > SCHEMA_VERSION`): rejected as `UnsupportedVersion`
  (forward-compatibility rejection — the contract cannot safely apply an unknown format).
- **In range**: accepted; checksum is verified next before data is written.

### Error codes

| Contract | Error variant | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `remittance_split` | `RemittanceSplitError::UnsupportedVersion` | 8 |
| `remittance_split` | `RemittanceSplitError::ChecksumMismatch` | 9 |
| `savings_goals` | `SavingsGoalError::UnsupportedVersion` | 6 |
| `savings_goals` | `SavingsGoalError::ChecksumMismatch` | 7 |
| `data_migration` | `MigrationError::IncompatibleVersion` | — |

### Bumping the schema version

When the snapshot format changes:

1. Increment `SCHEMA_VERSION` in the affected contract(s).
2. If old snapshots can still be safely imported, leave `MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged.
3. If old snapshots are no longer safe to import, bump `MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` to match.
4. Add a new test asserting that the previous version is accepted or rejected as appropriate.
5. Update this table.

### Events emitted

Both `remittance_split` and `savings_goals` emit an event on every `export_snapshot`
call containing the `schema_version` value for indexer consumption:

| Contract | Topic 1 | Topic 2 | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `remittance_split` | `"split"` | `"snap_exp"` | `schema_version: u32` |
| `savings_goals` | `"goals"` | `"snap_exp"` | `schema_version: u32` |
