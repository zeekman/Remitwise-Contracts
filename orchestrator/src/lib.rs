//! # Cross-Contract Orchestrator
//!
//! The Cross-Contract Orchestrator coordinates automated remittance allocation across
//! multiple Soroban smart contracts in the Remitwise ecosystem. It implements atomic,
//! multi-contract operations with family wallet permission enforcement.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The orchestrator acts as a coordination layer that:
//! 1. Validates configured contract addresses before execution
//! 2. Validates permissions via the Family Wallet contract
//! 3. Calculates remittance splits via the Remittance Split contract
//! 4. Executes downstream operations:
//!    - Deposits to Savings Goals
//!    - Pays Bills
//!    - Pays Insurance Premiums
//!
//! ## Address Validation
//!
//! Before executing any cross-contract calls, the orchestrator validates:
//! - No address references the orchestrator itself (prevents self-referential calls)
//! - All addresses are distinct (prevents misconfiguration where same contract serves multiple roles)
//!
//! This validation occurs early in the execution flow to minimize gas costs on invalid inputs.
//!
//! ## Atomicity Guarantees
//!
//! All operations execute atomically via Soroban's panic/revert mechanism:
//! - If any step fails, all prior state changes in the transaction are reverted
//! - No partial state changes can occur
//! - Events are also rolled back on failure
//!
//! ## Gas Estimation
//!
//! Typical gas costs for orchestrator operations:
//! - Address validation: ~500 gas
//! - Permission check: ~2,000 gas
//! - Remittance split calculation: ~3,000 gas
//! - Each downstream operation: ~4,000 gas
//! - Complete remittance flow: ~22,500 gas
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use orchestrator::{Orchestrator, OrchestratorClient};
//!
//! // Execute a complete remittance flow
//! let result = orchestrator_client.execute_remittance_flow(
//!     &env,
//!     &user_address,
//!     &1000_0000000, // 1000 tokens (7 decimals)
//!     &family_wallet_addr,
//!     &remittance_split_addr,
//!     &savings_addr,
//!     &bills_addr,
//!     &insurance_addr,
//!     &goal_id,
//!     &bill_id,
//!     &policy_id,
//! );
//! ```
