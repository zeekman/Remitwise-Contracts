## 1. System Overview

### Architecture

The Remitwise system consists of 10 smart contracts:

**Core Financial Contracts:**
- `remittance_split` - Allocates incoming remittances by percentage
- `savings_goals` - Goal-based savings with locking mechanisms
- `bill_payments` - Recurring and one-time bill tracking
- `insurance` - Micro-insurance policy management

**Coordination & Access Control:**
- `family_wallet` - Multi-signature family fund management
- `orchestrator` - Cross-contract remittance flow coordinator

**Reporting & Utilities:**
- `reporting` - Financial health aggregation and analytics
- `data_migration` - Import/export with checksum validation
- `rate_limiter` - (Minimal implementation)
- `analytics` - (Minimal implementation)

### Data Flow

```
Incoming Remittance → remittance_split → [savings_goals, bill_payments, insurance]
                                    ↓
                            orchestrator (coordinator)
                                    ↓
                            reporting (aggregator)
```

## 5. Security Gaps

### 5.1 Critical Gaps

❌ **No Authorization in Reporting Queries**
- **Gap:** Reporting contract allows any caller to query any user's financial data
- **Missing Control:** Caller verification or access control lists
- **Risk:** Complete privacy violation, information disclosure
- **Recommendation:** Add `caller.require_auth()` and verify `caller == user` or implement ACL

✅ **Reentrancy Protection (Implemented)**
- **Previously:** Orchestrator made multiple cross-contract calls without reentrancy guards
- **Mitigation:** `ExecutionState` lock in instance storage guards all public entry points (`execute_savings_deposit`, `execute_bill_payment`, `execute_insurance_payment`, `execute_remittance_flow`). Reentrant calls receive `ReentrancyDetected` (error 10). Lock release is guaranteed on both success and error paths via closure-based execution pattern.
- **Verification:** Comprehensive tests confirm guard blocks concurrent access, releases on success/failure, and supports sequential operations

❌ **Emergency Mode Lacks Rate Limiting**
- **Gap:** Emergency transfers not rate-limited or cooldown-enforced
- **Missing Control:** Transfer frequency limits, cooldown enforcement
- **Risk:** Rapid fund drain in emergency mode
- **Recommendation:** Enforce cooldown between emergency transfers, add transfer count limits

### 5.2 High-Priority Gaps

❌ **Weak Checksum Validation**
- **Gap:** Data migration uses simple checksum, not cryptographic hash
- **Missing Control:** SHA-256 or similar cryptographic hash
- **Risk:** Collision attacks, corrupted data passing validation
- **Recommendation:** Replace with SHA-256 or BLAKE2b

❌ **No Balance Verification**
- **Gap:** Contracts track balances but don't verify actual token balances
- **Missing Control:** Token balance queries and reconciliation
- **Risk:** State-balance mismatch, double-spending
- **Recommendation:** Add balance verification functions, periodic reconciliation

❌ **Pause State Not Synchronized**
- **Gap:** Each contract has independent pause state
- **Missing Control:** Global pause coordinator or cross-contract pause propagation
- **Risk:** Partial system pause, inconsistent security posture
- **Recommendation:** Implement global pause mechanism or pause state synchronization

### 5.3 Medium-Priority Gaps

❌ **No Storage Bounds**
- **Gap:** Maps grow unbounded, no limits on entity creation
- **Missing Control:** Maximum entity counts, storage quotas
- **Risk:** Storage bloat, DoS through excessive creation
- **Recommendation:** Implement per-user entity limits, storage quotas

❌ **Mixed Storage Types**
- **Gap:** Savings goals uses both persistent and instance storage
- **Missing Control:** Consistent storage type usage
- **Risk:** TTL mismatch, state inconsistency
- **Recommendation:** Standardize on single storage type (persistent recommended)

❌ **No Contract Address Validation**
- **Gap:** Reporting contract doesn't validate configured addresses
- **Missing Control:** Contract existence checks, interface validation
- **Risk:** Silent failures, malicious contract injection
- **Recommendation:** Validate addresses are contracts, verify interfaces

❌ **Role Expiry Not Consistently Enforced**
- **Gap:** Some functions don't check role expiry
- **Missing Control:** Consistent expiry checks across all role-based functions
- **Risk:** Expired roles retain temporary access
- **Recommendation:** Add expiry check to all role-based functions

### 5.4 Low-Priority Gaps

❌ **No Upgrade Mechanism**
- **Gap:** Version tracked but no actual upgrade function
- **Missing Control:** Contract upgrade or migration mechanism
- **Risk:** Stuck with bugs, no security patch path
- **Recommendation:** Implement upgrade mechanism or document migration process

❌ **Insufficient Error Differentiation**
- **Gap:** Many functions use panic!() instead of Result types
- **Missing Control:** Structured error types, error codes
- **Risk:** Difficult debugging, poor error handling
- **Recommendation:** Use Result types consistently, define error enums

❌ **No Input Bounds**
- **Gap:** String inputs, amounts have no maximum limits
- **Missing Control:** Maximum length/value validation
- **Risk:** Storage bloat, calculation issues
- **Recommendation:** Add maximum limits for strings and amounts

❌ **Audit Log Unbounded**
- **Gap:** Audit logs grow without limit
- **Missing Control:** Automatic cleanup, log rotation
- **Risk:** Storage bloat, increased costs
- **Recommendation:** Implement automatic cleanup or log size limits

❌ **No Pause Reason Tracking**
- **Gap:** Pause events don't include reason
- **Missing Control:** Reason field in pause events
- **Risk:** Operational confusion, delayed incident response
- **Recommendation:** Add reason parameter to pause functions

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

#### 1. Add Authorization to Reporting Contract
**Issue:** T-UA-01
**Action:** Implement caller verification in all reporting query functions

```rust
pub fn get_remittance_summary(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,
    user: Address,
    // ... other params
) -> RemittanceSummary {
    caller.require_auth();
    if caller != user {
        // Check if caller has permission (ACL, admin, etc.)
        panic!("Unauthorized access to user data");
    }
    // ... existing logic

#### 2. Implement Reentrancy Protection ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue:** T-RE-01
**Action:** Reentrancy guard implemented in orchestrator

**Implementation details:**
- `ExecutionState` enum (`Idle` / `Executing`) stored under `EXEC_ST` key in instance storage
- `acquire_execution_lock()` atomically checks and sets state; returns `ReentrancyDetected` (error 10) on conflict
- `release_execution_lock()` resets to `Idle` unconditionally
- All four public entry points guarded: `execute_savings_deposit`, `execute_bill_payment`, `execute_insurance_payment`, `execute_remittance_flow`
- Closure-based execution pattern ensures lock release on all code paths
- `get_execution_state()` public query for monitoring
- 15+ tests covering: initial state, lock release on success/failure, reentrant call rejection, sequential execution, recovery after failure

---

#### 3. Add Emergency Transfer Rate Limiting
**Issue:** T-EC-02
**Action:** Enforce cooldown and transfer limits in emergency mode

    let em_config: EmergencyConfig = env.storage().instance().get(&symbol_short!("EM_CONF")).expect("Emergency config not set");

    let current_time = env.ledger().timestamp();
    if current_time < last_transfer + em_config.cooldown {
        panic!("Emergency transfer cooldown not elapsed");
    }

    // Update last transfer time
